# LunarVim Configs

This is my lvim config folder setup.

You can use them by clonning it into your local lvim config folder:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:humrochagf/lvim-config.git ~/.config/lvim
```

It requires [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/installation) to be installed.

For clipboard support install `xclip`.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup was tested with lvim stable version running with NVim `0.9`
